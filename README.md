# 🌌 Three.js Solar System Simulation

This project is a **personal learning exercise** to explore 3D rendering and animations using **Three.js**. It simulates a basic solar system with planets, moons, and camera controls. Users can interact with the scene to explore the solar system in real-time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🪐 **Animated Solar System**: Planets and moons orbit around the sun in smooth animations.  
- ☀️ **Interactivity**: Clicking on the sun **pauses** all animations.  
- 🎥 **Camera Controls**: Users can rotate, zoom in/out, and pan the scene using `OrbitControls`.  
- 💡 **Real-Time Rendering**: Powered by Three.js for efficient and beautiful 3D rendering.
